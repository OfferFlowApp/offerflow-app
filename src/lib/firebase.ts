// Firebase integration has been removed from this application.
// This file is intentionally left blank or can be deleted.
// The original error regarding missing Firebase environment variables
// was because the .env.local file was not correctly set up.
// To re-enable Firebase, you would need to:
// 1. Restore the original content of this file.
// 2. Ensure a .env.local file exists in the project root
//    with all the correct NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_... variables.
// 3. Restart the Next.js development server.
